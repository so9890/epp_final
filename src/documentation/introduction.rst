Documentation of the 'Real consumption inequality and monetary policy project'. The documentation refers to the code for one specific month:
12/1995. So far, it mainly contains data management steps and finally calculates percentile-specific expenditure shares.
It also includes one piece of analysis: plots showing the evolution of real expenditures over time for the poorest and the richest 10\% of 
the income distribution using different deflation methods. In other words, the plots constrast real expenditures based on the aggregate CPI calculated 
using expenditure weights based on all urban US household's consumption baskets and an heterogeneous CPI based on percentile-level 
consumption baskets.
